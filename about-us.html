                    <h5>TEAM:</h5>
                    <p class="content-block">
                        We are a group of God-fearing freedom lovers calling on our fellow
                        humanity (we the people) who believe in individual freedom and rights to
                        join our cause. Our primary aim is to financially support those people and
                        organizations that contribute to the collective resistance against the
                        globalist-elite forces actively trying to suppress, oppress and enslave the
                        people inside their tyrannical world government.</p>
                    <p class="content-block">We are apolitical and want to unify all good people under the banner of
                        liberty, not divide people along party lines, races, classes, etc.! Everyday
                        more and more of us are waking up and seeing the enemy’s central ploy is
                        to “divide and conquer” us, but that’s a loser’s game in the end. What
                        better way than crypto decentralization to raise the funds the people need
                        to dissolve the elite’s centralized financial stranglehold on us, along with
                        their psychological operations against us?</p>
                    <p class="content-block">Since the inception of crypto, it has been our most deadly weapon in the
                        fight against central bank elites, the governments they pay / extort, and the
                        power they employ to control us. For hundreds of years the 'elites' have
                        been successfully stealing from the people of the world through unfair,
                        criminal financial systems, products, taxes, and regulations designed to kill
                        off the middle class, while enriching themselves.</p>
                    <p class="content-block">A few short years ago, most of us didn’t understand how this could be so,
                        but due to the emergence of decentralized technology and other factors,
                        the elite became panicked. In a state of fear, they have declared all out
                        war with humanity and this overreach has awakened the masses to their
                        existence. How they operate against us is now known, and this is revealing
                        how we are not only going to remove their stranglehold around our necks,
                        but also put them all to the just end they deserve.</p>
                    <p class="content-block">Crypto is a deciding weapon for humanity and foretells our ultimate
                        freedom. Part of this freedom will include the right of individuals to have a
                        safe and secure means of value transfer and savings, without the need for
                        the centralized middlemen oligarchs. This terrifies the elite for obvious
                        reasons. Their power is money and they have done all in their power to
                        keep it from the masses.</p>
                    <p class="content-block">Our project allows all humanity to immediately and continuously be an
                        unstoppable charitable funding machine to preserve all of our individual
                        rights and to arm humanity's destruction of globalist tyranny. This will result
                        in our inalienable right to the pursuit of life, liberty and happiness for all.
                        Any motive and operation to steal these rights from any man is clearly an
                        evil, but the only power that evil has is the power people give it. Once the
                        majority of us wakes up and says NO, how can thousands of elites survive
                        against billions of unified people? Of course, they can’t; they know it and
                        we know it. Our cause here is to inform, fund and eliminate these
                        criminals, in the minority.</p>
                    <p class="content-block">Our team has a deep and thorough knowledge of the crypto markets and
                        blockchain technology, with decades of combined experience. We also
                        have deep experience in marketing and entertainment industries to propel
                        our mission further.</p>
                    <h5 class=" pb-4">OPERATIONS:</h5>
                    <p class="content-block">We will initially be launching $BRANDON on the Binance smart chain
                        (BSC) due to the affordable fees, and plan to launch on other blockchains
                        in the future.
                        We are to be a charitable funding mechanism, and we'll also be introducing
                        our own line of NFT's called, The Icons Of Freedom. Our DeFi financial
                        services will commence Qtr 1, 2022: staking, farming (see road map)
                        We plan to utilize everything the crypto space has to offer to help in the
                        fight for freedom!</p>

                        Earlier this year, he became interested in crypto as he was searching for
                        alternative ways to create wealth at a relatively low entry point. As a person
                        that enjoys being independent, he appreciates the control and freedom
