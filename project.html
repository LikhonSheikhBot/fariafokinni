                    <h5>THE HISTORY:</h5>
                    <p class="content-block">
                        • A trend began spreading in the U.S. where people chant "F@#$ Joe Biden" at professional
                        sporting events and major concerts in protest of U.S. President Joe Biden.</p>
                    <p class="content-block">• A prominent TikToker posted a compilation of people chanting "F@#$ Joe
                        Biden" at college sports games, concerts and a crowded bar, gaining over 232,000 views in less
                        than 2 weeks</p>
                    <p class="content-block">• The 45th President of the United States of America, Donald Trump, hosted
                        a pay-per-view boxing event where the crowd chanted "we want Trump" then "F@#$ Joe Biden".</p>
                    <p class="content-block">• NASCAR racer Brandon Brown won his first NASCAR Series. Brown was
                        interviewed on the race track by NBC after the race. During the interview the crowd started
                        chanting "F@#$ Joe Biden." The interviewer then tried to imply they were shouting “Let’s go
                        Brandon,” but the listeners knew what they were hearing! The clip was shared to Twitter on that
                        day, gaining over 3.8 million views, 28,000 likes and 10,000 retweets in less than four days.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-block">• Twitter users began using the phrase "Let's go Brandon" in place of the
                        more vulgar, "F@#$ Joe Biden" in order to criticize the U.S. President and the #LetsGoBrandon
                        hit number one on Twitter. It satisfied those who didn’t want children to hear vulgarity, but
                        wanted to express the same sentiments.</p>
                    <p class="content-block">• As the meme continues to spread, musical artists have started recording
                        songs titled "Let's Go Brandon" in protest of Joe Biden. Four of the top spots on the U.S.
                        iTunes charts were filled by songs titled "Let's Go Brandon," including one of these songs
                        making number one, two, five and six. One artist posted a music video that has gained over 4.4
                        million views.</p>
                    <p class="content-block">• The "Let's go Brandon" chant is now being heard in protests all around
                        the world, from Brazil to England, France, Spain and many more.</p>
                    <p class="content-block">• Our team began preparations to create the Let’s Go Brandon Token
                        ($BRANDON). The Let’s go Brandon phenomenon is much more than just a political statement in one
                        country, it is a proclamation by much of humanity, which is sick and tired of the erosion of
                        freedom, government over reach, and the manipulation of our markets and our society by the
                        global elites! Our goal is to support global freedom against tyranny.</p>
                    <h5 class=" pb-4">OPERATIONS:</h5>
                    <p class="content-block">We will initially be launching $BRANDON on the Binance smart chain
                        (BSC) due to the affordable fees, and plan to launch on other blockchains
                        in the future.
                        We are to be a charitable funding mechanism, and we'll also be introducing
                        our own line of NFT's called, The Icons Of Freedom. Our DeFi financial
                        services will commence Qtr 1, 2022: staking, farming (see road map)
                        We plan to utilize everything the crypto space has to offer to help in the
                        fight for freedom!</p>
                    <h3 class="text-center pb-4">LET’S GO BRANDON TOKEN!</h3>
                    <h5 class="pt-5 pb-4">PROJECT OVERVIEW:</h5>
                    <p class="content-block">
                        Our innovative tokenomics will allow $BRANDON community the power to
                        not only earn passive income on an appreciating asset, but will also allow
                        us to make our voices heard in the form of choosing which entities will
                        receive the charitable donations.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-block">
                        $BRANDON will also incentivize our community through airdrops at critical
                        milestones for our project. The incentives and milestones will be based on
                        social media participation and market cap (MC) levels:
                        • $100MMC
                        • $500MMC
                        • $1BMC
                        • $5BMC
                        • $10BMC
                        • $100BMC
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-block">The social media participation will include token giveaways, community
                        airdrops, and fun friendly competition. Make sure to follow all our social
                        media for updates and competition start-times.</p>
                    <p class="content-block">Our charity wallet will be controlled by a legal trustee who will be
                        contractually obligated to follow the directives of the community’s vote.
                        After your vote is heard, our trustee will immediately process the transfer of
                        funds to the chosen charity / individual.</p>
                    <p class="content-block">Our NFT collection, Icons of Freedom (first launch drop of NFT: Qtr 4,
                        2021) will also contribute to our charitable fund. 50% of revenues from the
                        NFT auctions will be added to the charity wallet. There will be select
                        special auctions, which will also include new music tracks by Topher and
                        group, exclusively for the $BRANDON charitable contribution wallet and
                        community. Only 1776 of these one-of-a-kind NFTs will ever be minted,
                        and they will continuously contribute each time these NFTs are sold, via a
                        5% charitable fee charged to the seller. NFT auctions will drop on holidays,
                        during special events and fundraisers.</p>
                    <p class="content-block">We plan to be partner with a blockchain voting-tech company to afford us
                        transparent accountability and credibility, so that our community’s voices
                        are heard. On November 30, 2021 Project Veritas (already decided to be
                        the first charity recipient) will receive its donation. The following month on
                        December 30, 2021 the first community vote will be held to select the next
                        $BRANDON charity recipient. These monthly votes and all NFT auctions
                        will continually take place on the 2nd to last day of each month.</p>
                    <p class="content-block">In quarter one 2022, $BRANDON will be partnering with a major native
                        wallet for transactions, along with a native blockchain and decentralized
                        social media platform to call home. This platform will offer full DeFi
                        capabilities for staking and farming with great APY rewards for the
                        $Brandon community. This is a serious mission we are all embarking on to
                        make a substantial difference in this fight for humanity. Again, our goal is
                        to fund the real freedom fighters in all capacities, until every last person
                        involved in crimes against humanity has been rooted out and brought to
                        justice.</p>
                    <p class="content-block">As said, The Veritas Foundation will be the recipient of $BRANDON's first
                        charitable donation. Veritas has come under attack recently from an
                        obviously corrupt, weaponized, and unconstitutional FBI. We are told
                        Veritas’ own offices and the personal homes of their reporters have been
                        raided. The FBI, at the bidding of the Biden administration, continues to
                        treat the few American journalists left as criminals for trying to report the
                        truth. This is a dangerous precedent that we the people reject. If we lose
                        the last vestiges of freedom of speech and press through government and
                        big tech oppression, we will lose our right to the knowledge of the crimes
                        being committed against us, and, therefore, our ability to defend ourselves
                        and rights.</p>
                    <p class="content-block">Voices that shine light on all the corruption, lies, deceit, and theft
                        being
                        enacted by elite corporations and government agencies must be heard!
                        Choosing The Veritas Foundation as our first charitable donation
                        demonstrates our dedication to freedom. It also is a battle cry to freedom
                        loving people everywhere: let’s now unite one and all, regardless of
                        nationality, ethnicity, gender, political party, class, religion, philosophy, etc.
                        – for we all know in our hearts that we are one family under a higher
                        Power, obviously equal and unique expressions of that Power.</p>
                    <p class="content-block">We are ALL most certainly are awake now, and certainly do not comply
                        with nonsensical evil. We will not stand by in a bewildered fog and watch
                        corruption run rampant in our great nation and our world for one more day.
                        Yes, it is hard for good people to accept such arrogant evil actually exists,
                        but once awake, we waste little time standing aghast at it, we simply
                        destroy it. The opposition knows this and is terrified of awakened
                        Americans, for they have never lost a war for their liberty. The American
                        government lost wars when controlled by the globalist elite, and they will
                        surely lose this one against the American people, as well.</p>
                    <p class="content-block">The spirit of liberty and the understanding why that is God-inspired and
                        mandated is in the American spiritual DNA. Several decades of elitist
                        revision of our history books could never erase this DNA in our children.
                        The elite have a high opinion and dependence on their intellectualism, but,
                        of course, it is all foolishness to the higher wisdom. Such intellectualism is
                        actually the deepest form of ignorance, a flimsy reed, which will soon snap
                        and pierce them through the heart.</p>
                    <p class="content-block">Thankfully, many, if not a majority of the American people, and our global
                        brethren, have been awakened by the criminals’ desperation and
                        overreach. We Americans feel great pride in all those fighting for justice
                        over our seas, and we join you all now. Buy $BRANDON, make money in
                        the process, and know your involvement is adding to the funding of our
                        freedom fighters against tyranny. The battle will not be long, and it will most
                        likely be won in the voting box, before any shot is fired at the elite. But, we
                        will not be satisfied with that. Justice will be done for crimes against our
                        humanity, in accordance with the constitution they tried to kill.</p>

                        Topher is a billboard charting Independent Hip-Hop Artist from Mississippi.
                        Earlier this year, he became interested in crypto as he was searching for
                        alternative ways to create wealth at a relatively low entry point. As a person
                        that enjoys being independent, he appreciates the control and freedom
                        crypto currency provides to those taking part in the movement.
